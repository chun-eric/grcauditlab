### To see the Final Report click on the attached ```Audit Lab Final Report v2.pdf``` in this repository or see it in the bottom of this README.md.

## Background
This audit focused on examining the Media Protection controls at Falcone Systems, specifically to check if they align with the guidelines set out in NIST SP 800-53 regarding Media Controls. 
Falcone Systems 
We structured the audit into six detailed steps, using NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2, which covers the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-federal systems and organizations, 
as our primary reference. 

We then compared and aligned the security measures at Falcone IT Systems with the Media Protection controls from NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, 
ensuring that they meet the requirements for safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information.


Below are the six steps we took to undertake this audit.

<br/>

## Step 1 - Audit Preparation

In order to prepare for the audit, two questions were asked.

1. <strong>What controls were we auditing?</strong> 
  - After contacting Falcone Systems IT department, it was determined that it would be Falcone Systems’ Media Protection controls that needed to be audited based on NIST SP 800-53.
    An excel spreadsheet from NIST SP 800-171 revision 2 was used as a base template.

2. <strong>Who did we need to talk to in order to gather our audit information?</strong>
  - After communicating with the appropriate personnel from Falcone Systems, we had scheduled meetings with two key personnel from Falcone Systems:

| Job Title |	Name	| Date	| Location |
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
| Director of IT | John Finnegan | 23rd February 2024 |  Falcone Systems HQ |
| Network Engineer |	Sam Cunningham |	23rd February 2024 |	Falcone Systems HQ |

All audit interview questions were prepared before the onsite interview was conducted and necessary documents such as 
Falcone IT Systems’ Standard Operating Procedure and Security Plan were requested for review before the onsite audit interview.

<br/>

 
## Step 2 - Audit Logistics

For the external audit of Falcone IT Systems, it was not feasible to be assigned a liaison officer. 
Instead, a focused 90-minute meeting was scheduled directly with key personnel—Director of IT John Finnegan and Network Engineer Sam Cunningham—at the Falcone IT Systems Headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. 

The objective was to efficiently conclude the onsite interview within 60 minutes, allowing for an additional 30 minutes if needed to cover all necessary ground.

<br/>


## Step 3 - On-site Audit (Data gathering)
 
The on-site audit interview was conducted using tailored questions derived from NIST SP 800-53 Media Controls, addressing both interviewees simultaneously. 
The primary goals of this audit phase were to:

- [x] Ensure comprehensive data collection during the interview.
- [x] Determine the implementation status of Media Protection controls.
- [x] Document evidence, noting both the provider and the nature of the evidence.
  
With the interviewees’ consent, the session was both recorded and documented through notes.

Data collection encompassed interviews, document reviews, and testing to verify active implementation of processes.

For any additional information or to address pending action items, quick follow-up communications were promptly executed via email and phone after the audit interview.

<br/>


## Step 4 - Post Audit Reconciliation (Data cleaning)

Our goal here is to ensure that we have collected all the necessary data. Any missing data must be gathered as soon as possible.
We are now starting to organize this data into the excel spreadsheet and inputting it under the following column headings.

Below is a sample.

| Data Collection |	Evidence Detail	| Findings	| 
| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
| Interview |	Director of IT	| No controls in place	| 
| Tested |	Network Engineer	| Reviewed Documentation of Media Markings	| 

<br/>

Data Collection can be:
*	Interview form – can be via recorded Zoom or in-person.
*	Documentation – these are documentation provided by the interviewee.
*	Tested – a process that the organization currently uses.

Evidence Detail can be:
*	The person who provided the evidence.
*	A documented record or process.

Findings:
*	This is the information that was given by the Evidence detail. 
*	The findings here must be factually verifiable.


<br/>


## Step 5 - Analysis 

In this step, our objective is to assess the effectiveness of the security controls under audit. 

We've introduced a ```Disposition``` column with four predefined values to describe the status of each control:

- [x] Not in Place: Indicates that the security control is absent.
- [x] Not Applicable: Indicates that the security control is unnecessary or currently not relevant.
- [x] Partially Implemented: Indicates that the security control is only partially put into effect.
- [x] Fully Implemented: Indicates that the security control is fully in place and effective.
 
The Disposition value is determined objectively by evaluating the gathered data for each control. 
This assessment is conducted individually for every control included in the audit.

<br/>


## Step 6 - Reporting our Findings (Final Audit Report)

The Final Audit Report is compiled and presented. This an audit report and not a risk report. 
You can add the risk findings in the final report after a risk assessment if needed.

##  Executive Summary

In March 2024, Knight Security conducted a comprehensive cybersecurity
audit of Falcone Systems, focusing on evaluating the effectiveness and
efficiency of the company\'s Media Protection controls. These controls
are crucial for safeguarding information throughout its lifecycle,
preventing unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

The audit, grounded in the framework provided by NIST SP 800-53 and NIST
SP 800-171 Rev. 2, assessed Falcone Systems\' adherence to established
media protection protocols through interviews, document reviews, and
process testing.

The key findings in the audit were:

-   **Lack of Formal Policies**: Absence of documented media protection
    policies and procedures, leading to inconsistent practices.

-   **Effective Controls**: Proper media access and use controls are in
    place, including non-auto-mounting USBs, access control lists, and
    data loss prevention measures.

-   **Partial Implementations**: Inconsistencies in media markings and
    sanitization documentation were noted, indicating a need for
    standardized procedures.

-   **No Controls in Key Areas**: Missing controls for media storage and
    downgrading, posing significant security risks.

To close these gaps, Falcone Systems is advised to develop and implement
comprehensive policies and procedures, standardize processes for media
marking and sanitization, and introduce governance for media storage and
downgrading. Implementation is recommended within 2 to 4 months,
supported by regular compliance audits and a culture of continuous
improvement.

Addressing these recommendations will strengthen Falcone Systems\'
defense against data breaches and align its practices with cybersecurity
best practices.

##  Objective & Scope

The objective of this audit is to evaluate the effectiveness and
efficiency of existing Media Protection controls at Falcone Systems.
These controls are designed to safeguard information stored on both
physical and electronic media throughout their lifecycle, preventing
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

The audit included a review of Falcone's information security policies
and processes in place during the FY of 2023.

##  Methodology

To fulfill the objectives of the audit, a third party Auditor, Knight
Security implemented their audit program, to evaluate Falcone Systems\'
Media Protection controls based on the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 Security and Privacy
Controls for Information Systems and Organizations. A template derived
from NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2 Protecting Controlled Unclassified
Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations served as the
foundational framework for the audit process and was mapped to NIST SP
800-53 Media Protection (MP) controls.

Coordination with Falcone Systems facilitated onsite in-person
interviews with two integral members of Falcone's IT team as shown in
Fig. 1.

(Fig. 1)

Preparation for the audit included the formulation of interview
questions, tailored specifically to assess the Media Protection controls
as per NIST SP 800-53. This was complemented by a request for critical
documents, including Falcone IT Systems\' Standard Operating Procedures
and Security Plan, to be reviewed prior to the on-site interviews.

The on-site audit interview was conducted using tailored questions
derived from NIST SP 800-53 Media Protections Controls, addressing both
interviewees simultaneously. The primary goal of this audit phase were
to:

1.  Ensure comprehensive data collection during the interview.

2.  Determine the implementation status of Media Protection controls.

3.  Document evidence, noting both the provider and the nature of the
    evidence.

4.  With the interviewees' consent, the session was both audio recorded
    and documented through notes.

Data collection encompassed interviews, document reviews, and testing to
verify active implementation of processes.

For any additional information or to address pending action items, quick
follow-up communications were promptly executed via email and phone
following the audit interview.

The immediate goal following data collection was to compile and
categorize the gathered information into an organized excel spreadsheet,
adhering to specified column headings indicative of data type, evidence
details, and findings. (See Fig. 2 for an example)

Each piece of data---whether obtained through interviews, documentation,
or testing---was recorded via audio recording or documented, ensuring
that all findings are supported by factually verifiable evidence.

##  Audit Findings

The audit findings associated for each media protection control will be
explained below.

A separate risk assessment report will outline the risks and
vulnerabilities associated with these audit findings.

Each control is given a disposition value after data analysis as shown
in Figure 6. The value meanings are self-explanatory.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Disposition                        Value Meaning
  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------
  Not in Place                       Control is not in place

  In Place                           Control is in place and effective

  Partially In Place                 Control is not fully in place

  N/A                                Control is not necessary or required
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

(Fig. 6)

**MP1: Policy and Procedures**

**Status**: Not in Place.

**Findings**: Falcone Systems did not have any stored or documented
media protection policy or procedure currently in place. The process was
mostly undertaken by company ritual processes on an inconsistent basis
by senior members of the IT department with some process written but not
fully compiled.

**MP2: Media Access**

**Status:** In Place.

**Findings:** Falcone Systems USB drives are not auto mounted. All
sensitive data is protected through access control lists and all
database access is logged and tracked. A data loss prevention (DLP)
process is also implemented blocking any data exfiltration of media
files.

**MP3: Media Markings**

**Status**: Partially in Place.

**Findings**: Falcone Systems documentation of identified media for
markings for Covid data and its financial data were inconsistent. All of
Falcone Systems Covid data had markings however its financial data did
not have consistent markings. This made it very confusing to attribute
whether the financial data was highly sensitive or not.

**MP4: Media Storage**

**Status**: Not in Place.

**Findings**: No control or governance around thumb drive usage and
storage were found to be in place at Falcone Systems including any
documentation or training.

**MP5: Media Transport**

**Status**: In Place.

**Findings**: Falcone System's employees are prohibited from
transporting company data during travel. Instead, the company utilizes
cloud storage, enabling staff to access data directly from the cloud.
Additionally, any system designated for maintenance or repair undergoes
a thorough data wipe to remove sensitive information before being
returned or discarded.

**MP6: Media Sanitization**

**Status**: Partially in Place.

**Findings**: Sanitization of media items is happening but
inconsistently documented. Evidence detail showed reviewed last three
audit records of HDD destroyed. One was recent, but the other two were
three years old.

**MP7: Media Use**

**Status**: In Place.

**Findings**: There are no USB auto mounting allowed at Falcone Systems.
All USB drives that are mounted are tracked and logged, and pre-approved
within by an Access Control List. Only verified USB devices are allowed
to mount otherwise the USB device is blocked and denied access.

**MP8 Media Downgrading**

**Status**: Not in place.

**Findings**: There are no documented processes for media downgrading of
sensitive data.

A quick overview of the findings for each media protection control is
shown in Figure 7.

### Compliance Audit Lab Documentation/Walkthrough

## Background:
This audit focused on examining the Media Protection controls at Falcon IT Systems, specifically to check if they align with the guidelines set out in NIST SP 800-53 regarding Media Controls. We structured the audit into six detailed steps, using NIST SP 800-171 Revision 2, which covers the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-federal systems and organizations, as our primary reference. We then compared and aligned the security measures at Falcon IT Systems with the Media Protection controls from NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, ensuring that they meet the requirements for safeguarding Controlled Unclassified Information.


Below are the six steps we took to undertake this audit.

## Step 1 - Audit Preparation

In order to prepare for the audit, two questions were asked.
1. What controls were we auditing? 
After contacting Falcon Systems IT department, it was determined that it would be Falcon Systems’ Media Protection controls that needed to be audited based on NIST SP 800-53.
An excel spreadsheet from NIST SP 800-171 revision 2 was used as a base template.
2. Who did we need to talk to in order to gather our audit information?
After communicating with the appropriate personnel from Falcon Systems, we had scheduled meetings with two key personnel from Falcon IT Systems:
Job Title	Name	Date	Location
Director of IT	John Finnegan	23rd February 2024	Falcon Systems HQ
Network Engineer	Sam Cunningham	23rd February 2024	Falcon Systems HQ

All audit interview questions were prepared before the onsite interview was conducted and necessary documents such as Falcon IT Systems’ Standard Operating Procedure and Security Plan were requested for review before the onsite audit interview.

 
## Step 2 - Audit Logistics

For the external audit of Falcon IT Systems, it was not feasible to be assigned a liaison officer. Instead, a focused 90-minute meeting was scheduled directly with key personnel—Director of IT John Finnegan and Network Engineer Sam Cunningham—at the Falcon IT Systems Headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. The objective was to efficiently conclude the onsite interview within 60 minutes, allowing for an additional 30 minutes if needed to cover all necessary ground.


## Step 3 - On-site Audit (Data gathering)
 
The on-site audit interview was conducted using tailored questions derived from NIST SP 800-53 Media Controls, addressing both interviewees simultaneously. The primary goals of this audit phase were to:

1. Ensure comprehensive data collection during the interview.
2. Determine the implementation status of Media Protection controls.
3. Document evidence, noting both the provider and the nature of the evidence.
With the interviewees’ consent, the session was both recorded and documented through notes. Data collection encompassed interviews, document reviews, and testing to verify active implementation of processes.

For any additional information or to address pending action items, quick follow-up communications were promptly executed via email and phone after the audit interview.



## Step 4 - Post Audit Reconciliation (Data cleaning)

Our goal here is to ensure that we have collected all the necessary data. Any missing data must be gathered as soon as possible.
We are now starting to organize this data into the excel spreadsheet and inputting it under the following column headings.

Below is a sample.
Data Collection	Evidence Detail	Findings
Interview	Director of IT	
Documentation	Network Engineer	
Tested	Director of IT	

Data Collection can be in the following form:
•	Interview – can be via recorded Zoom or in-person.
•	Documentation – these are documentation provided by the interviewee.
•	Tested – a process that the organization currently uses.

Evidence Detail can be:
•	The person who provided the evidence.
•	A documented record or process.

Findings:
•	This is the information that was given by the Evidence detail. 
•	The findings here must be factually verifiable.



## Step 5 - Analysis 

In this step, our objective is to assess the effectiveness of the security controls under audit. We've introduced a "Disposition" column with four predefined values to describe the status of each control:
Not in Place: Indicates that the security control is absent.
Not Applicable: Indicates that the security control is unnecessary or currently not relevant.
Partially Implemented: Indicates that the security control is only partially put into effect.
Fully Implemented: Indicates that the security control is fully in place and effective.
The Disposition value is determined objectively by evaluating the gathered data for each control. This assessment is conducted individually for every control included in the audit.


## Step 6 - Reporting our Findings (Final Audit Report)

The Final Audit Report is compiled and presented. This an audit report and not a risk report. You can add the risk findings in the final report after a risk assessment if needed.

Included in the final audit report are the following sections:

# Executive Summary 
•	Overview: A concise overview of the audit’s objectives, scope, and main findings. Designed for high-level stakeholders.
•	Key Findings: Highlights critical vulnerabilities or compliance issues.
•	Recommendations Summary: Summarizes recommended actions.

# Introduction
•	Purpose of the Audit: Describes objectives and triggers of the audit.
•	Scope: Details examined systems, networks, and data.
•	Methodology: Explains audit methods and tools.

# Audit Methodology and Standards
•	Audit Procedures: Specific procedures followed, including automated and manual checks. Listing the people the auditors interviewed.
•	What was Audited?
•	Standards and Frameworks: Cybersecurity standards and frameworks used as benchmarks. This is the specific set of controls based off a framework such SP 800-171 or NIST CSF.

# Detailed Findings and Analysis
•	Security Controls Assessment: Effectiveness of existing security controls.
•	Compliance Assessment: Compliance with laws, regulations, and standards.
•	Linking the spreadsheet so anyone can verifiably fact check.
•	Vulnerabilities Identified: Detailed list of discovered vulnerabilities, categorized by severity.

•	Optionally can add a High Level compliance status (e.g. Listing the top 25 controls and implementation status next to it)

# Risk Assessment (wait)
•	Risk Analysis: Identified risks based on likelihood and impact.
•	Risk Prioritization: Prioritizing risks to guide mitigation efforts.


# Recommendations and Action Plan (optional)
•	Mitigation Strategies: Recommendations for mitigating identified vulnerabilities.
•	Implementation Timeline: Timeline for implementing recommendations.
•	As the auditor you could provide a fix in order to help ensure the org get compliant

# Conclusion
•	Overall Security Posture: Closing assessment of the organization's cybersecurity posture.
•	Provide key takeaways from the audit such as critical issues and implementation recommendations. 
•	Future Recommendations: Next steps for continuous improvement.


# Appendices
•	Glossary
•	Detailed Logs and Evidence – supporting documents and evidence collected
•	Audit Team Members
